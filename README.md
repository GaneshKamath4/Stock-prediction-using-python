 Stock Market Technical Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing stock market data, performing technical analysis, and making predictions using machine learning and time series analysis. The script uses popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, yfinance, statsmodels, and pandas_ta.

## Features

 **Stock Price Analysis:**
  - Fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
  - Calculates technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, On-Balance Volume (OBV), Stochastic Oscillator, Average Directional Index (ADX), Williams %R, and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF).

 **Machine Learning Prediction:**
  - Utilizes linear regression to predict the next day's closing stock price based on historical price and volume data.
  - Evaluates prediction performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics.

  **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Performs time series analysis on a sample dataset using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).
